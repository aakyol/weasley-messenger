# Weasley Messenger

# What is this?
An app to have an automatic process that sends messages to pre-defined receivers. No longer manually texting your mom or your significant other when you arrive home safely.

# Why you started such a project?
I am one of the victims of sending manual messages periodically. This is a good way to ease manual labour on my messaging activities.

# Any problems?
Feel free to inform, will fix it ASAP.
